## Description

This is a backend only application which mocks a social media platform. The main functionality of the application is for users to create thoughts, react to other users thoughts, and add friends.

This application invloved several routes for each of the models.

The user routes allow us to get all users, get a single user by their user ID, create a new user, update a user, and delete a user.

For more functionality, a user can be added to another user's friend list. A user can also be deleted from another user's friend list.

For thought routes, a user is able to add, delete, and update thoughts. Users can also react to individual thoughts.

Both friend count and reaction count functionality is built in through the use of virtuals to track number of friends and number of reactions with a single integer.

## Installation

This application requires Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
